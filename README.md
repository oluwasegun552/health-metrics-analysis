## **README: Health Metrics Dashboard Analysis**

### **Project Overview**
The **Health Metrics Dashboard Analysis** provides a comprehensive view of health outcomes, patient demographics, and resource utilization across different medical conditions and insurance providers. Using this analysis, healthcare professionals and decision-makers can gain valuable insights into patient improvements, areas of high disease prevalence, and how different insurance providers contribute to the total patient pool. This analysis is crucial for driving informed public health policies and optimizing resource allocation.

### **Data Source**
The dataset used for this analysis contains anonymized health metrics covering:
- Patient information by medical condition
- Number of improved patients by gender
- Patients grouped by blood type and insurance provider
- Total patient billing
- Patient admission type

### **Objective**
The goal of this analysis is to:
1. Identify key health trends based on medical conditions.
2. Visualize patient improvements and gender disparities.
3. Analyze the distribution of patients by insurance providers.
4. Provide actionable insights for healthcare decision-makers to improve population health.

### **Tools Used**
- **Power BI** for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
- **Excel** for initial data cleaning and preparation.

### **Key Insights**
- **Total Patients:** There were **56,000 patients** in total.
- **Medical Conditions:** Arthritis emerged as the most prevalent condition, with 9,308 patients, followed closely by asthma with 9,185 patients.
- **Improved Patients:** A total of **19,000 patients** showed improvement, almost evenly split between male and female patients, at 9,345 males and 9,172 females.
- **Insurance Providers:** Cigna and Aetna had the largest share of patients, with Cigna covering 11,249 patients and Aetna covering 10,913.
- **Total Billing:** The total billing amount across all patients was **$1.42 billion**, highlighting the financial scope of healthcare services provided.

### **Visualization Breakdown**
The dashboard is structured into the following sections:
1. **Total Patients by Medical Condition:** A bar chart showing the distribution of patients suffering from different conditions, with a focus on arthritis and asthma.
2. **Improved Patients by Gender:** A comparison of male and female patient improvement rates.
3. **Patients by Insurance Provider:** A breakdown of the total number of patients covered by major insurance providers such as Cigna, Aetna, and UnitedHealthcare.
4. **Total Patients by Blood Type:** A visualization that classifies patients by their blood type, giving additional context for health-related decisions.

### **Conclusion**
This analysis provides a data-driven approach to understanding healthcare challenges and patient outcomes. It highlights areas that need attention, such as conditions like arthritis and asthma, which affect a large number of patients. The insights can guide resource allocation and interventions, making this an essential tool for healthcare system improvement.
